# Analysis-of-Discounts-on-Tech-Products
This project applies data cleaning and data quality methodologies to analyze discount patterns and their impact on average revenue for tech products between January 2017 and March 2018.
The goal of the analysis was to determine whether offering product discounts leads to higher sales and overall profitability. Through timeline and statistical analysis, the findings revealed that discounts up to around 30% were the most effective — providing a noticeable increase in sales — while larger discounts offered diminishing returns.

This insight helps inform data-driven pricing strategies, allowing businesses to optimize discount levels without negatively impacting revenue performance.
